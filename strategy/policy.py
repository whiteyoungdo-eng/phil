"""Betting policy over frozen forecast beliefs (scored by core/replay.py).

AGENT-EDITABLE. Given a recorded forecast (belief est_prob plus the book at
record time), decide whether to bet, which side, and how much. Beliefs are
frozen; only the decision rule evolves. Keep a change only if the held-out
walk-forward score from `python3 core/replay.py` improves.

Contract: decide(row, state) -> None | {"side": "yes"|"no", "stake_usd": x}
Optional fit(history) -> state for walk-forward-learned parameters.

Rules (v3, 2026-09-02):
  1. Both sides are candidates. Yes fills at the ask; No fills at 1 - bid.
     Edge = belief for the side minus its fill price.
  2. Bet only in the small-edge band 0.02 <= edge <= 0.07. Larger claimed
     edges are where the beliefs are overconfident: the >0.10 band is 0W/5L
     in the bet ledger and net negative in every veto counterfactual, and on
     replay 0.07-0.10 adds bets without adding return.
  3. Fill price must sit in 0.10..0.90. Below 0.10 the beliefs carry the
     classic longshot bias (0 for 16 on replay across both sides); above
     0.90 the payoff cannot cover the miss rate.
  4. Never buy a token priced 0.20 <= price < 0.45, on either side (v3).
     This is the mid-longshot zone and the beliefs are badly miscalibrated
     there: over every settled row with a non-negative edge on that side
     (78 rows, any spread, any edge size) the bought token wins 18% of the
     time at a mean price of 0.32 and a mean belief of 0.39, for -0.49 per
     $1 staked. Yes side: 45 rows, 16% wins. No side: 33 rows, 21% wins.
     Every neighbouring boundary (0.15/0.25 low, 0.40/0.47/0.50 high) also
     beats v2, so the zone is a plateau, not a tuned edge. The 0.10-0.20
     band stays open: it is thin (about 25 rows universe-wide) but net
     positive on both sides.
  5. Spread (ask - bid) <= 0.03. A wide book means the recorded ask is not
     a real price, and on the frozen beliefs every spread bucket from 0.03
     to 0.07 is net negative across all candidates (35 rows, -12.3 per $1
     staked) while 0.00-0.02 is positive. The cap is inclusive and the
     spread is rounded to 4 places first: half the 3-cent books fail a raw
     float comparison.
  6. Flat $5 stake. Edge-scaled, Kelly, price-scaled, price-tiered and
     max-stake sizing all lowered the held-out score. Price-tiered ($10
     above 0.5, $2 below) is the most robust sizing without the Bank of
     Israel rows (+0.168 / +0.143) but costs 0.14 of headline cw_return.

Replay scores below are IN-SAMPLE. Every threshold was chosen with all
420 settled rows visible and the policy has no fit() step, so the
walk-forward split holds nothing out from the rule selection. The first
out-of-sample evidence is the forecasts still open on 2026-09-02.

FORWARD TEST RUN 2026-10-07 (operator machine; this is the out-of-sample
check the paragraph above deferred). `core/replay.py --after
2026-09-02T00:00:00Z`: 854 rows settled after the cutoff, none of them
visible when these thresholds were chosen.
  cw_return -0.0419   pnl +36.91   roi +0.0761   brier_delta -0.0054
  bets 97/854   win_rate 0.67
In-sample cw_return was +0.743. Held out it is -0.0419: the headline
edge did not generalise. Two readings pull opposite ways.
  (a) The return is a lottery. One row (Gruene >=7% of second votes)
      pays +39.64, which is 107% of total pnl; ex-top-1 the policy is
      -2.73 and ex-top-2 it is -24.05 across the remaining 95 bets.
      This is the Bank of Israel shape recurring in an unrelated family,
      and it is now the third headline number concentration has carried.
  (b) Row selection does beat the market on accuracy: brier_delta
      -0.0054 over the 97 chosen rows. That is a per-row mean, so two
      outliers cannot manufacture it. A baseline implementing only
      risk.json's numeric gates (min_edge 0.04, max_edge 0.10,
      max_spread 0.06, Yes only, flat $5) scores +0.0026 on the same
      window: 60 bets, win_rate 0.52, pnl +22.28, ex-top-1 -17.37.
Ruling: do NOT promote these thresholds into risk.json on this evidence.
The accuracy signal is real but has not converted into robust return.
The comparison is also not clean - that baseline omits playbook.md's
qualitative vetoes, so live behaviour is better than the number shown.
Re-run this forward test once ~400 further rows have settled, and read
cw_return next to the ex-top-1 and ex-top-2 pnl rather than alone.
Replay (5 folds, 420 settled rows, 336 in scored folds): cw_return +0.743,
pnl +121.68 on 19 bets, brier_delta -0.0248. 10 folds: +0.624.
Without the Bank of Israel rows: +0.388 (5 folds) / +0.287 (10 folds),
the first version that is clearly positive on that check.
v2 (no dead zone) scored +0.345 / +0.240 with pnl +101.83 on 26 bets,
and +0.033 / -0.047 without the Bank of Israel rows.
v1 (spread <= 0.06) scored +0.239 / +0.155 with pnl +92.93 on 29 bets.
Baseline (the written risk.json rules: Yes only, edge 0.04-0.10, flat $5)
scores -0.506 held out, pnl -3.06 on 10 bets.
Caveat: two sibling Bank of Israel rows at price 0.12 contribute +73 of
the pnl; the no-Bank-of-Israel numbers above are the robustness check.
Rejected in the v3 round (lower headline score, or a gain that vanished
without the Bank of Israel rows): a 6h/24h/48h floor on time to
resolution, a walk-forward calibration shrinkage toward the market mid
(history Brier picks a factor near 0, so it kills almost every bet),
MIN_PRICE 0.30/0.45/0.50, MAX_PRICE 0.95, MIN_EDGE 0.015/0.025, MAX_EDGE
0.08/0.10, spread cap 0.02, requiring fit_score, preferring the No side
when both qualify.
